E-commerce Sales Data Analysis
This project demonstrates the use of SQL and Python to analyze and visualize e-commerce sales data. The analysis includes a variety of metrics, such as total sales per category, customer retention, year-over-year growth, top customers by spending, and more. The script connects to a MySQL database and performs queries to extract valuable insights, then visualizes them using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
MySQL Server
MySQL connector (mysql-connector-python)
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
To install the required Python libraries, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas matplotlib seaborn
Database Setup
This project assumes that you have a MySQL database set up with the following structure:

Database Name: ecommerce
Tables:
customers: Contains customer information such as customer_id, customer_city, and customer_state.
orders: Contains order details such as order_id, order_purchase_timestamp, and customer_id.
order_items: Contains order items linked with products and orders.
payments: Contains payment information such as order_id and payment_value.
products: Contains product information such as product_id, product_category, and price.
You will need to replace the database connection details in the script with your own credentials.

db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    username="root",
    password="12345",
    database="ecommerce"
)
Analysis Overview
This project performs the following analyses:

Unique Customer Cities: List all unique cities where customers are located.
Orders in 2017: Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
Total Sales by Category: Calculate the total sales per product category.
Installment Payments: Calculate the percentage of orders paid in installments.
Customer Count by State: Count the number of customers from each state and visualize the data in a bar chart.
Monthly Orders in 2018: Calculate the number of orders placed per month in 2018 and visualize with a bar chart.
Average Products per Order by City: Calculate the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
Revenue Distribution by Category: Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
Correlation between Price and Purchase Frequency: Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times it has been purchased.
Total Revenue per Seller: Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.
Moving Average of Order Values: Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
Cumulative Sales per Month: Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.
Year-over-Year Growth Rate: Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
Customer Retention Rate: Calculate the retention rate, defined as the percentage of customers who make a second purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
Top Spending Customers per Year: Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.
Running the Script
To run the script, simply execute it after configuring the database connection:

bash
Copy
Edit
python e_commerce_analysis.py
The script will execute various SQL queries, retrieve data from the database, and display the results through the console or as visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs).

Results
The results of the analysis include:

Insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behaviors.
Graphs visualizing customer distribution, order trends, and more.
Key performance indicators (KPIs) for sales, customer retention, and revenue.
