# E-commerce Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing and extracting insights from an e-commerce dataset stored in a MySQL database. The dataset includes information on customers, orders, payments, products, and sales. The analysis performed includes various business metrics such as total sales, order counts, customer distribution, and product category performance.

## Key Tasks Performed

### 1. **Data Loading & Connection**
   - Connected to a MySQL database using `mysql.connector` and loaded necessary tables (`customers`, `orders`, `payments`, `products`, `order_items`).

### 2. **Data Exploration & Aggregation**
   - **Unique Cities**: Retrieved a list of distinct customer cities.
   - **Order Count in 2017**: Calculated the total number of orders placed in 2017.
   - **Total Sales per Category**: Found the total sales for each product category by joining `products`, `order_items`, and `payments`.
   - **Installment Payment Percentage**: Calculated the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
   - **Customer Count per State**: Counted the number of customers from each state and visualized the result.
   - **Monthly Order Count in 2018**: Calculated the number of orders placed in each month of 2018.
   - **Average Products per Order by City**: Calculated the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.

### 3. **Sales Performance**
   - **Percentage of Total Sales by Category**: Found the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
   - **Correlation between Price and Purchases**: Identified the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
   - **Seller Revenue Ranking**: Calculated the total revenue generated by each seller and ranked them.
   - **Moving Average of Order Values**: Calculated the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.

### 4. **Advanced Analysis**
   - **Cumulative Sales per Month**: Analyzed cumulative sales per month for each year.
   - **Year-over-Year Growth Rate**: Calculated the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
   - **Customer Retention Rate**: Attempted to calculate the retention rate by finding the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first.
   - **Top 3 Customers by Spend**: Identified the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization (e.g., bar charts and line graphs).
- **MySQL Connector**: For connecting to and querying data from a MySQL database.

## Purpose

This project serves to analyze various key performance indicators (KPIs) within an e-commerce environment, such as order trends, revenue analysis, customer behavior, and product performance. The insights drawn from this analysis can inform business strategies and operational improvements. 

By performing these analyses, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of customer patterns, product profitability, and sales performance across different time periods.

## Future Work

- **Customer Segmentation**: Further analysis could segment customers based on their buying behavior for targeted marketing.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning models could be applied to predict future sales, customer churn, or demand forecasting.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Interactive dashboards could be developed for real-time analysis and decision-making.
